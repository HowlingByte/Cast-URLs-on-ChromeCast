# Cast URL's on your ChromeCast
From a simple CSV file where you put your links, to your ChromeCast thanks to a little python script.

## Prerequisites
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage
At first, the goal of this app was to get your likes from your twitter account and from them, get the URL of the images inside of them to then share it on your CH, but now that the API ins't free anymore.. We've change our mind, now you'll be able to share anything to it, just put the link in the CSV file.
